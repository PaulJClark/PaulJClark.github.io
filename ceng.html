  <h1>CEng Questions</h1>
  <h4>What are some of the standard business terms an engineering consultancy would include in their quotation.</h4>
    Professional Indemnity insurance up to Â£2 million as standard.<br>
    Any additional PI is at a premium to the client.<br>
    Work will only proceed when a signed copy of the quote is returned.<br>
    Valid for 3 months from quotation.<br>
    Typical 5 day return time.<br>
    The invoice becomes due for payment on the day it is submitted and the final date for payment is 28 days thereafter. Beyond this date, interest shall incur.<br><br>
    
    <h4>How is change managed in your business.</h4>
    Any variation or additional work required beyond the scope of the original quote will come at an
    additional fee, either by fixed quotation or using the agreed upon standard hourly rates.<br>
    We will propose both to the client and proceed as instructed.<br>

    <h4>Can you explain the implementation risk of temporary works.</h4>
    Implementation risk should not be confused with the category of check. The implementation risk for the same temporary works structure erected in two different locations can vary significantly depending on proximity to local assets, such as an adjacent railway line, thus justifying different levels of risk but the category of design check may remain the same. 

  <h4>When would you use Z clauses in an NEC contract.</h4>
  Z clauses are Additional Terms of Contract for NEC 3 & 4 contracts. 
  They are bespoke to the individual contract, in addition to the standard contract terms.
  They are generally overused and if poorly drafted, put additional risk on the contractor when compared to allowing for only the standard terms written by experienced and competent officials.

  <h4>How is your rate built up.</h4>
  When consulting engineers are billed to clients, the hourly rates typically include various overhead costs beyond just the engineer's salary.<br><br>

  These costs could cover expenses like office space, equipment, insurance, taxes, employee benefits, training, administrative expenses, and the company's profit margin. The difference between the billed hourly rate and the engineer's actual salary accounts for these additional costs and ensures the company remains financially sustainable while providing services.

  <h4>Can you explain the hierarchy of control measures.</h4>

  The hierarchy of control measures is a system used in occupational health and safety to prioritize and implement measures that mitigate risks and hazards in the workplace. It's structured in a way that emphasizes the most effective controls to the least effective. Here's the typical hierarchy:<br>

  <ol>
    <li>Elimination: This is the most effective control measure where the hazard is completely removed from the workplace. For instance, replacing a hazardous substance with a non-hazardous one or removing a risky process entirely.</li>

  <li>Substitution: If elimination isn't feasible, substitution involves replacing the hazardous material, equipment, or process with something less hazardous. For example, using a less toxic chemical in place of a more harmful one.</li>

  <li>Engineering Controls: These are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from the hazard. Examples include installing ventilation systems, barriers, or machinery guards.</li>

  <li>Administrative Controls: These controls involve changing work procedures or policies to minimize exposure to hazards. This might include adjusting work schedules, providing training, or implementing signage and warning systems.</li>

  <li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): When the above measures aren't sufficient, PPE is used to protect individual workers. This includes items like gloves, masks, helmets, or goggles. It's considered the least effective control measure because it relies on human behavior and proper usage.</li><br>
  </ol>
  
  The goal of this hierarchy is to encourage employers to prioritize more effective controls over less effective ones to minimize risks and ensure a safer work environment.

<h4>Who holds commercial risk between contractor and client in fixed price and target price contracts</h4>
    In fixed price contracts, the commercial risk typically lies more with the contractor. Here's why:<br><br>
    <strong>Fixed Price Contracts:</strong> In these agreements, the contractor agrees to complete the project for a set price. Regardless of any unforeseen circumstances or cost overruns, the contractor is usually responsible for completing the work within the agreed-upon budget. Any additional costs or risks due to delays, unexpected expenses, or changes in scope often fall on the contractor unless explicitly stated otherwise in the contract.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Target Price Contracts:</strong> In target price contracts, also known as cost-reimbursable contracts with a target cost, the commercial risk is shared between the client and the contractor. The contractor is reimbursed for their costs (plus an agreed-upon fee) up to a specified target cost. However, if the final costs exceed the target, there might be provisions for sharing the excess costs based on a pre-agreed formula.<br><br>
  
    In both cases, the specifics of the contract terms significantly influence where the commercial risk primarily resides. However, in fixed price contracts, the contractor typically bears more of the risk for cost overruns or unforeseen circumstances, incentivizing them to manage the project efficiently and effectively to stay within the agreed budget.<br>
