  <h1>CPR Communication Task</h1>
  <p><a href="https://ice.org.uk/media/xudb433u/professional-reviews-communication-task-submission-guidance.pdf">Official ICE Guidance </a></p>
  <h2>Task</h2>
  <p>You will be set two questions, each containing a scenario and a format. You will have to choose one question to respond to and have 90 minutes to complete the task. At the CPR and CPRP, the aim is to test your ability to take a piece of information, digest it, organize your thoughts, and present them logically and clearly, bearing in mind the audience that you are writing to. </p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <h3>Example 1 - Nuclear Energy</h3>
  <p>With global emissions on a seemingly unstoppable upward trend there are clear concerns
  that civil engineers are adding to the problem of climate change, but the construction of
  nuclear facilities could be one of a range of ways to reduce emissions. However, when
  Greenpeace claims “nuclear power is incredibly expensive, hazardous and slow to build” and
  with the catastrophic failure at Fukushima in 2011 in recent memory, many feel this is the
  wrong technology to use, and alternatives must be sought.<br>
  <br>You have been asked to write a piece by a journalist on this subject for inclusion in an
  industry supplement. </p> <br>

  <h3>Example 2 - Resilient Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>Covid-19 has shown us that there is a need for resilience to unexpected economic shocks in
  terms of our infrastructure and its design and maintenance. The time has come for a rethink
  of what kind of infrastructure is required and how engineers design, build, and maintain such
  infrastructure, as well as what training and development is needed to allow engineers to
  ensure its fitness for purpose.<br>
  <br>Write a blog for people with a technical background but without specialist knowledge in civil
  engineering.</p>

  <h2>Scenarios</h2>
  <p>Questions are not published in advance, 2022-2023 scenarios will be based on the following themes (The Presidential themes from 2020 Rachel Skinner and 2021 Ed McCann):</p>
